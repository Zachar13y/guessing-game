** Validating that user input is in the correct format, so that the app can accept uppercase/lowercase or shorthand answers.
** Adding a fourth question that takes a numeric input, and indicates to the user whether the guess is 'too high' or 'too low'.
** Notify the user at the end of the game how many questions they guessed correctly, so they can celebrate their awesomeness.
